# Code Quiz Challenge
Take a coding quiz and obtain a score based on your time and correctness!

## Description
Test your coding knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  You have 60 seconds to answer five random questions.  For each incorrect answer, your timer will go down by five seconds.  Your score is only recorded if you have at least one correct answer and more than zero seconds on the clock remaining.  The score will be the amount of time remaining.  You may choose not to record a score or clear the leaderboard.
